Question:- Objective: To create a member database and retrieve records from it. Problem: A member of a golf club is having the following attributes and methods. Create a class to represent a member of the club. Consider appropriate constructors or setter methods to set the details and a method display() to display the details of one member. Member class private int MemberID private String LastName private String FirstName private int Handicap private char Gender private String Team private String MemberType private int Coach private long Phone private Date JoinDate Constructors/setter methods void display() Create an array member[] of member objects and set the details. The details of the member table may look like the following. Each row represents a member details that is one Member class object.

Date class members private int day private String month private int year

Create an array member[] of member objects and set the details. The details of the member table may look like the following. Each row represents a member details that is one Member class object.

After the table of data created do the following tasks:  Display the records where the member’s JoinDate is earlier than 07-Apr-09.  Display the records of all the senior members whose handicap score is less than 12.  Display the records of all the female senior members who are part of TeamB.

Explanation :-

This project aims to develop a comprehensive member database system for a golf club, utilizing object-oriented programming principles in Java. The core of the project revolves around two main classes: Member and Date, encapsulating the attributes and behaviors of a club member and a date respectively.

The Member class comprises private attributes such as MemberID, LastName, FirstName, Handicap, Gender, Team, MemberType, Coach, Phone, and JoinDate. It includes constructors and setter methods to initialize and modify member details, along with a display method to showcase the member's information.

Additionally, the Date class is designed to represent the date of joining for each member, with attributes for day, month, and year.

The project involves creating an array of member objects and populating it with member details, typically organized in a tabular format.

Several tasks are performed on this dataset:

Filtering by Join Date: Records where the member's JoinDate is before 7th April 2009 are displayed. Senior Member Filter: Records of senior members with a handicap score less than 12 are extracted. Female Senior Member Filter by Team: Records of female senior members belonging to TeamB are retrieved. The project is structured to demonstrate proficiency in Java programming, particularly in implementing classes, encapsulation, array manipulation, and conditional filtering. Additionally, it showcases effective data handling techniques and problem-solving skills to meet specific criteria laid out by the project requirements.*
